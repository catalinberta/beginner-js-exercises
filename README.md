# beginner-js-exercises

A bunch of basic javascript exercises that start from easy to slightly more difficult and interactive exercises. 

One can use these as a refresher over various parts from javascript, from declaring functions to using HTML5 APIs.

This repo will probably get periodically updated.

# Instructions
Open the index.html file of each exercise with the inspector enabled and the console tab active to check all the helpful logs. 
Detailed instructions are in each exercise, or inside the JS files as comments. 
In general, there will be a boilerplate already set up for each exercise, only the missing pieces/solutions will need to be inserted inside the `<solution></solution>` comment tags.

See first exercise from the Array or Function exercises, as they are already solved as examples.

P.S. Feel free to contribute :)

Happy coding!

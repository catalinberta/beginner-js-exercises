# beginner-js-exercises

A bunch of basic javascript exercises that start from easy to slightly more interactive ones. 

One can use these as a refresher over various parts from javascript, from declaring functions to using HTML5 APIs.

This repo will periodically get updated (I think).

# Instructions
Instructions are in each directory, or inside the JS files as comments. 
In general, there will be boilerplates already set up, and only the missing pieces/solutions need to be inserted inside the `<solution></solution>` comment tags.

See first exercise from the Array exercises, as it is already solved as an example.

P.S. Feel free to contribute :)

Happy coding!
